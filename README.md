# University_Projects

This repository contains projects I have made for Algorithms and Data Structures classes in C++
Project_1: 
1.    Creates a linked list based on the data in the .txt file. 
2.    Takes data from the user and adds it to the linked list. 
3.    Writes products with prices below average. 
Project_2: 
1.    Takes name of the .txt file from the user and creates a linked list based on the data in the .txt file. 
2.    Adds new merch to the end of the linked list with average price and weight. 
3.    Deletes max 2 elements from the list.
Project_3: 
1.    Creates a BST and fills it with hard coded numbers. 
2.    Writes elements of the tree in inorder traversal. 
3.    Adds 10 random numbers to the tree. 
4.    Shows the largest number, height of the tree and number of elements
5.    Writes data stored in the BST to a linked list in inorder traversal
6.    Adds at the end of the list 10 random numbers
7.    Sorts the linked list with MergeSort algorithm
